# Twitter Mass Unfollow
A quick a dirty script to unfollow everyone you currently follow on Twitter.
Keys can be found at developer.twitter.com

## WARNING
Upon executing the unfollow.py script, there is no confirmation. Unfollowing begins immediately.

### Setup
1) Clone down this repo
2) Update the keys.py file with your relevant info (your screen name, auth keys, etc.)
3) Ensure you have the tweepy python library installed ("pip install tweepy" should do it)
4) Run python unfollow.py. 

### Improvements to be made
1) Add a requirements file
2) ~Add confirmation~
3) Remove key.py and have its creation and configuration handled by the script.
4) ~Cleanup the output~
5) Exceptions list
